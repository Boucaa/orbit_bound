  "selectLevel": "Select Level",
  "black_hole_merger_name": "Black hole merger",
  "black_hole_merger_description": "Mergers of black holes have opened a new observational window into the universe, can you navigate through such a merger?",
  "fzu_level_name": "FZU level",
  "fzu_level_description": "Get around the FZU logo to the target. There is more than one way to win, can you figure out all of them?",
  "kerr_name": "Kerr black hole",
  "kerr_description": "Most black holes rotate. When a black hole rotates, there is a preferred direction of orbit where spacetime is wound up on the black hole. Effectively, you get slowed when orbiting against this inertial drag, and accelerated if you choose the right direction.",
  "negative_mass_level_name": "Negative mass level",
  "negative_mass_level_description": "How could the physics of negative mass objects work? You can also imagine you are dealing with motion of particles with the same charge. Can you hit the target?",
  "newtonian_object_name": "Newtonian object",
  "newtonian_object_description": "Orbits of test particles around a simple newtonian body are always cone-sections: circles, elipses, parabolas, or hyperbolas. Can you use these orbits, bend the shot, and hit the target?",
  "orbitaround_name": "Stable orbit",
  "orbitaround_description": "A common engineering goal is to achieve a stable orbit. Can you try to make a full orbit around a planet?",
  "schwarzschild_name": "Schwarzschild black hole",
  "schwarzschild_description": "The simplest black hole is a spherically symmetric static black hole called the Schwarzschild black hole. Its gravity is so strong that a horizon exist where nothing can escape the immense force. Be careful so you dont fall in!",
  "slalom_name": "Slalom",
  "slalom_description": "This level contains only simple newtonian objects with some bothersome barricades, can you take on the challenge?",
  "sun_with_planet_name": "Sun with a planet",
  "sun_with_planet_description": "A gravitational slingshot is a maneuver used by many satelites to gain velocity and save fuel. This involves a flyby next to a planets relative motion to a central object. Can you use the planet to get a boost to the target?",
  "tutorial_name": "Tutorial",
  "tutorial_description": "Welcome to Orbit Bound! This is a tutorial level to get you started.",
  "variable_gravity_name": "Variable gravity object",
  "variable_gravity_description": "What if gravity isnt as straightforward as we think it is? Explore the choice of exponent of a 1/r^n potential to hit the target.",
  "wall_bounce_name": "Wall Bounce",
  "wall_bounce_description": "Bounce the ball off the wall",
  "target_description": "This is the target. Your goal is to hit it with the ball.",
  "ball_description": "This is the ball.",
  "wall_warning": "Don't hit the walls and reach the target.",
  "shooting_instruction": "You can shoot it by dragging your finger or mouse.",
  "good_walls_description": "These walls are ok to hit. Use them to your advantage.",
